KHATTAK HUB AUTOMATION - AGENT TRAINING MANUAL (SAMPLE)
======================================================

SECTION 1: THE HYBRID MODEL
---------------------------
Our philosophy is simple: Robots do the boring work, Humans do the important work.

- The Bot (n8n + WhatsApp) handles:
  - Initial greeting
  - Order collection (Item, Quantity, Address)
  - Order status checks
  - FAQs (Delivery charges, timings)

- The Human Agent handles:
  - Complex questions not in the menu
  - Angry customers / Complaints
  - Address verification for confusing locations
  - Payment issues

SECTION 2: ESCALATION PROTOCOL
------------------------------
When does the bot hand over to a human?

1. Keyword Trigger: If customer says "Human", "Agent", "Help", or "Masla" (Issue).
2. Failure Trigger: If the bot fails to understand the user 3 times in a row.
3. Sentiment Trigger: If the customer uses abusive language or negative sentiment words.

ACTION:
- The bot will send a message: "Connecting you to a support agent..."
- A notification is sent to the Admin Dashboard / Slack / WhatsApp Group.
- YOU (The Agent) must reply within 5 minutes.

SECTION 3: SAMPLE SCRIPTS (URDU/ENGLISH)
----------------------------------------

Scenario A: Late Delivery
Customer: "Where is my order? It's been 2 hours!"
Agent: "Assalam-o-Alaikum! Maazrat khwah hain takheer ke liye. Main abhi rider ki location check kar ke aap ko batata hoon. Bara-e-meharbani 2 minute dein."
(English: "Peace be upon you! Apologies for the delay. I am checking the rider's location right now. Please give me 2 minutes.")

Scenario B: Wrong Item Received
Customer: "I ordered Chicken Tikka but got Fajita."
Agent: "Hum is ghalti par sharminda hain. Kya aap ghalat item ki tasveer bhej sakte hain? Hum foran replacement rider bhej rahe hain."
(English: "We are embarrassed by this mistake. Can you send a picture of the wrong item? We are sending a replacement rider immediately.")

SECTION 4: TOOLS
----------------
- n8n Dashboard: Use this to see the flow of the conversation.
- Google Sheets: Check the 'Orders' tab for status.
